    notes: >
      This gene encodes a diacylglycerol kinase. This gene has not been directly
      implicated in resistance to pesticides in any insect species to date, but there
      are two hypotheses regarding a potential link to insecticide resistance in
      *Anopheles* based on studies in other species. (1) In several systems, *Dgk* genes
      act as negative regulators of synaptic transmission between cholinergenic neurons
      by limiting the amount of acetylcholine available at synaptic junctions. In
      *C. elegans*, loss of function mutations in a *Dgk* gene cause hyperactivity and
      hypersensitivity to aldicarb, a carbamate insecticide, presumably because of an
      increase in acetylcholine levels available at synaptic junctions. If *Dgk* performs
      a similar function in *Anopheles*, then a gain of function mutation might reduce
      sensitivity to carbamate and/or organophosphate insecticides. (2) In *Drosophila
      melanogaster*, the ortholog of this gene *Rdga* is expressed exclusively in the
      retina and modulates sensitivity to light, via the same pathway and mechanism
      described above. This gene is also under circadian control in *Anopheles gambiae*.
      If mutations in this gene affected sensitivity to light in *Anopheles*, and the gene
      is expressed under a circadian rhythm, then such mutations might also affect
      circadian behaviours, such as the timing of host-seeking and feeding behaviours.
