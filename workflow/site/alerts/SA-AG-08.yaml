    notes: >
      This gene encodes a protein within the *Maf-S*/*cnc*/*Keap1* pathway which regulates the
      expression metabolic insecticide resistance genes in response to oxidative stress.
      Under oxidative stress conditions, *cnc* is released by *Keap1*, which translocates
      into the nucleus and binds to the transcription factor *Maf-S*. The *cnc*/*Maf-S*
      complex then binds to antioxidant response elements in the genome, initiating
      transcription. *Maf-S* expression correlates with expression of multiple insecticide
      resistance candidates in *Anopheles gambiae*. Constitutive activation of this
      pathway causes resistance to multiple insecticides in *Drosophila melanogaster*.
