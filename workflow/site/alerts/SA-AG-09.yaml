    notes: >
      This gene encodes a diacylglycerol kinase. The ortholog of this gene in
      Drosophila melanogaster is expressed exclusively in the retina and modulates
      sensitivity to light. In general, Dgk genes may act as negative regulators of
      synaptic transmission. In C. elegans, loss-of-function mutations in a Dgk gene
      cause hypersensitivity to aldicarb, a carbamate insecticide. This gene may also
      be under circadian control in Anopheles gambiae.
