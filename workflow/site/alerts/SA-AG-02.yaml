    notes: >
      This gene encodes an acetylcholinesterase enzyme wich is the binding
      target of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. Variants in this
      gene are associated with insecticide resistance, including the G280S
      mutation (also known as G119S in Torpedo californica codon numbering)
      and copy number variation.
