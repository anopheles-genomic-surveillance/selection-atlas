  - identifier: "AGAP000818"
    names:
      - "Cyp9k1"
      - "cytochrome P450"
    notes: >
      This gene encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme which is associated with pyrethroid
      resistance through increased expression and where copy number variation has been
      observed in Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii.
