  - identifier: "AGAP002862"
    names:
      - "Cyp6aa1"
      - "Cytochrome P450"
    notes: >
      This gene encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme where spanning copy number variants are
      found in populations of Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles
      arabiensis and variants have been associated with pyrethroid resistance.
